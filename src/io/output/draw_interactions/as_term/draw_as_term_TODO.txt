In order to have a more homogeneous and detail graphical representation,
write the term with the same Font and color scheme as the interaction diagrams

To do so:
- create a png for each node with draw_colored_text or whatev
- compose with dot, do not draw node frames
- use nodesep=0 and ranksep=x on the graph for managing spacing and have a better handling of layout
